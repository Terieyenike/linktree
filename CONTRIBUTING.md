## Getting Started
We recommend you work on the changes in your local environment because most of the contribution process requires you to do so rather than directly on GitHub.

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the `fork` button at the top of the front page. <br>
Forking is a process to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. You always want to remember to fork a repository before cloning it.

### 2. Clone the repository in your local machine

Clone a repository means copying the remote repository into your local machine.

#### On GitHub

1. Click your profile picture on the right top.
2. Click "Your repositories".
3. Open the forked repo by clicking on it.
4. Click the green `<> Code` button.
5. Click the copy icon to copy the HTTPS URL.

#### On your local machine

1. In your terminal, run this command to create a copy of the forked repository in your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https_url
   ```

   Change the `https_url` with the HTTPS link that you've copied.

2. Navigate to the directory where your local repository lives.

   ```bash
   cd linktree
   ```

Remember that you always want to work on and push your changes into the forked repository, not the original one.

### 3. Create a branch

A branch is an isolated environment to work on and save your changes. Later on, you will push this branch to the remote repository after you finish working on your changes.

Run the following command to create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b working-branch-name
```

You can name the branch anything you want â€” for example, `feature-add-text`.

### 4. Add your changes

After you finish working on your changes, you must add them first. Adding changes means moving them into the staging area, where they will be ready to be saved (committed).

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
```

This command will add all files with changes to the staging area.

### 5. Commit your changes

Now, it's time to commit the changes. Committing changes means saving your changes.

Run the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

Change `Your message` into your own message. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Feat add a new background to profile"
```

### 6. Push your changes

You want to push your changes to your remote (forked) repository. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

Change `your-branch-name` with the name of your working branch. For example:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-add-text
```

### 8. Create a pull request (PR)

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub. <br> To ensure you're on the forked repo, look at the repo name on the top left beside the GitHub logo. It should have your GitHub username in the beginning: `your-username / repository-name`.
2. Click the `Compare & pull request` green button on the top.
3. Fill in the pull request form.
4. Click the green `Create pull request` button on the bottom.

And that's it! Congratulations on your first contribution to this repo! ðŸŽ‰

## Resolve merge conflicts

You might encounter merge conflicts. When you encounter merge conflicts, you need to resolve them before your pull request can be merged into the `main` branch to avoid collision.

Merge conflicts usually occur when changes are on the same line(s), in the same file(s), from 2 different branches. It is common to encounter merge conflicts when contributing to open source.
